# GIF control with a rotary encoder on STM32F411-Nucleo
Notable features:
- written in CMSIS
- Simple ST7735S LCD driver implementation
- Rotary Encoder input handling using TIM3 timer in Encoder mode
- Rotary Encoder input detection using EXTI interrupts
- DMA + SPI with interrupts for efficient command/data transfer to LCD
